`estimate_average_spacing_per_gene.m` - this function estimates the average nucleosome spacing near the 5' end of each yeast gene.  
The algorithm used to estimate the spacing was described in the Supplemental Material of *Ocampo et al. - Nucleic Acids Res. (2016)*, section "Estimation of nucleosome spacing".
